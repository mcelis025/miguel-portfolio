      <p>Are you in need of a highly reliable and motivated team member? Throughout the 4 years of my military career, I learned what it means to be part of a team. Communication, discipline, and integrity are key qualities that helped me be successful and qualities that I will bring to future teams. I am looking for a position as a web developer to put those skills into practice.</p>
      <p>My military career has taught me to work in an environment that can change at any moment. I have been recognized by Senior Management as Airman, employee, of the Quarter due to my excellent management and problem-solving skills. I have led operations with teams that maintained accountability over items valued at $935M.</p>
      <p>I truly believe that the work ethic and skills I have acquired throughout my life will provide a unique perspective to any team! Allow me to show you how great of an addition I can be in your team!</p>
